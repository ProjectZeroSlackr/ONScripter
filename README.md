Overview:
ONScripter
- ONScripter is the open-source clone of NScripter.
  ONScripter already officially supports iPodLinux.
- NScripter is a widely-used visual novel engine
  used in many popular games such as Tsukihime,
  Hanihani, Mizuiro, and Higurashi.
- The ZeroSlackr version is built from Haeleth's
  source code which has English language support.
